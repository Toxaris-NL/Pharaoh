This is a game engine built on top of the Monogame game framework. Whenever I need something for a game and I think it belongs in the engine, I will add it.

## background
I like to program in my spare time, mostly things that I find enjoyable and of use. When I grew up, my parents first bought a ZX-81 (with ROM pack!) and shortly after a ZX Spectrum 48k. I really loved that machine and still do. Still I find it amazing what it could do with so little. It set me on my path for my work and that is where I started to enjoy programming in my free time.
Anyway, one of my favorite games on that machine was Fred. In itself quite simple, an explorer in a maze that has to escape. I still enjoy playing it every now and then. So, when I decided I wanted to learn how to code games, it was an obvious candidate. I choose the Monogame framework, which is quite a low-level framework. That would give me more opportunity to program. As most of my interest is in 2D or pseudo-3D anyway, it seems like a good fit.
As it is a low-level framework, quite some stuff needs to be handled by yourself every time. I don't like to do things multiple times, so I started to collect these things as an engine to power my games.

## What it can do
It has some basic capabilities, which will be added upon when needed. It probably is not the best way forward all the times, but it works for me.

Current capabilities:
- Animation via spritesheets
- Collision detection (circle and rectangle plus combination)
- Collision detection intersection (so, the overlapping rectangle)
- Level structure and handling
- Assetmanager
- Inputhelper to handle mouse and keyboard
- Visibility Timer
- Gameobjects like Sprite and Text
- Some UI components

Upcoming capabilities:
- Camera
- Layers
